With this challenge, we were looking at all of the earthquakes within the past 7 days. I plotted them on a map, and when you click on each earthquake you are able to see some data
about each one. Like for instance, time, depth, magnitude and location. I also created a legend that shows specifically the depth of the earthquake.
